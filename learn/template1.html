    This is text outside a 'p' tag.

    Notice how I write it on multiple lines?

    I can even          put lots     of space between the words.

    But in the end they all become one.
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>If I put two paragaphs on the same line they will appear separated when you view them in a browser.</p>

    <h1>Let's learn about some other elements. This is a level one header</h1>

    <h2>There is also a level two header.</h2>

    <h3>And three</h3><h4>And four</h4><h5>And so on</h5>

    <p>The following elements are called "inline" elements, because they don't break the flow of test. <b>This one is bold,</b> and <i>this one is in italics</i>. How about <u>this one, which is underlined?</u>.</p>

    <p>Want more? <a href="#">This is a link</a>. 'a' stands for 'anchor'. I have no idea what the relationship between anchors and links are. Just remember it's 'a'. Do you see the <b>href="#"</b> inside the "a"? 
      That's an attribute. The "href" attribute of a "a" element tells the link where to go. That link says to go to "#", which bascially means, don't go anywhere. Here's <a href="https://www.google.com">another link</a>.
    Can you guess where clicking it will take you?</p>

    Below is a button:

    <button>I'm a button</button>

    Buttons don't do anything unless you add JavaScript to them. I'm not going to explain how that works now though.

    <p>Want more? How about "unordered lists"?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is an unordered list</li>
      <li>"li" stands for "list item</li>
      <li>Try changing the "ul" to "ol" and see what it does.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And that's enough for now. Until next time!</p>
